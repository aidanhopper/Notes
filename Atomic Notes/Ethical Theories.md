# Ethical Theories

There are four primary ethical theories.
1. **Consequence-based**: Based on the principle of social utility; act to yield the greatest good for the greatest number.
2. **Duty-based**: based on the principle of duty or obligations humans have to one another and never on the consequences of human behavior.
3. **Contract-based**: Based on the idea that humans should act to satisfy their own natural desires, but because humans are rational, this will result in a systsem that will protect them from harm by others.
4. **Character-based**: Based on the idea that individuals with strong moral character will do the right thing.

## Theories

### Utilitarianism

Introduces the idea of utility and how maximizing utility will lead to the best outcomes for society. Utility is determined by the amount of happiness it produces.

**Rule Utilitarianism**: Consequce-based on *rules* rather than acts. One critique of rule utilitarianism is that there is no *intrinsic* motivation to be moral (John Stuart Mill).

**Act Utilitarianism**: Based on acts. One issue with act utilitarianism is that it can justify the exploitation of the minority (Immanuel Kant).

A critique of both is that they are fundamentally flawed because morality is tied to happiness or pleasure and determined by consequences of acts or rules. Morality should not be grounded in consequnces or happiness.

### Deontology

A duty-based theory that morality must be based on obligations humans have to one another and never the consequences of human actions. Need to apply Kant's two categorical imperatives: impartiality and universality. We must address both categorical imperatives when using rule deontology in an argument.

**Impartiality**: Individuals should not be treated as a means to an end but respected and valued.

**Universality**: Same rules apply to everyone.

One critique of deontology is that it will not help us in cases where we have two or more *conflicting* duties. This can lead us to moral dilemmas.

To analyze a situtation with duty-based theories you must identify *prima facie* (self-evident) duties that are relevant to a situation.

### Social Contract & Rights-Based Contract Theory

Contract-based ethical theories provide motivation for being moral, unlike utilitarianism or deontology. We establish a "social contractl" where we mutually agree to follow certain rules. To create a just and orderly society, we are motivated to follow established contracts that preserve natural rights (Thomas Hobbes).

### Virtue Ethics

Character-based theory that ignore outside systems. Practicing virtues such as honesty, integrity, and generosity will lead to *strong moral character*. A virtue is a moral characteristic that a person must have to live well. To analyze a system with virtue ethics identify the virtues that play a role in the situtation.

One critique of virtue ethics is that it is limited. It does not resolve conflicts between competing virtues and it does not examine the consequnces of an action.
