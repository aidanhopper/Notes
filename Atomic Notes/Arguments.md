# Arguments

Claims can be true or false, but arguments can either be invalid or valid. To determine whether an argument is valid we **assume** all premises are true.

A valid argument is **sound** when all the premises are true. But an argument cannot be sound if it is not valid.

**Deductive** arguments are based on logic. **Inductive** arguments are invalid, but their premises provide strong support for the conclusion. this means the conclusion is *very likely* to be true when the premises are true.

An argument can also be **fallacious** if the conclusion is not likely, even when the premises are true. An argument can be valid even if one or more of its premises is false and its conclusion is also false.

## Falacy Types

There are many different types of falacies.

1. Ad hominem
2. Slippery slope
3. Appeal to authority
4. False cause fallacy
5. Fallacy of ambiguity/equivoction
6. False dichotomy
7. Appeal to people
8. Virtuality
9. Begging the question

# Steps For Evaluating Arguments

1. Convert the argument into standard form (list of premises and conclusion)
2. Test for validity
3. Is the argument valid? if valid go to step 4, else go to step 5.
4. Test valid argument for soundness and go to step 7.
5. Check to see if invalid argument is inductive or fallacious.
6. Determine whether inductive premises are either true or false in the real world.
7. Make an overall assessment of the argument by determining both (a) the argument's strength of reasoning (valid, inductive, or fallacious) and (b) the truth conditions of each of the premises.

If an argument is sound or inductive then it is strong. Otherwise it is weak.
